# JavaScript Temperature Converter

While Kelvin is the SI Unit of temperature, people generally prefer Fahrenheit or Celsius unit type to measure temperature. We have built a temperature converter that will convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa using JavaScript.

HTML file contains the calculations and JavaScript code, open it in Notepad to view the code.

An image for convert sign is used which is placed along in the same directory.
